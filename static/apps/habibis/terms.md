# Terms of Use

**Last updated:** January 2026

By using Habibis, you agree to these simple terms.

## The Basics

Habibis helps you stay in touch with friends by tracking when you last reached out and reminding you when someone's due for a catch-up.

## Your Responsibilities

- Use the app for its intended purpose
- Don't try to break or reverse-engineer anything
- Be kind to your friends (that's the whole point)

## Our Responsibilities

- Keep the app working as best we can
- Not mess with your data
- Be transparent about what the app does

## No Warranties

The app is provided "as is." We do our best, but we can't guarantee it'll be perfect or available 100% of the time.

## Changes

We might update these terms occasionally. If we do, we'll update the date above.
