# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2026

Habibis is designed with your privacy in mind. We don't track you, we don't sell your data, and we don't want to know your business.

## What We Access

**Contacts (with your permission)**
We access your contacts only to help you add friends to the app. We never upload your contact list to any server.

Your friends, notes, moods, and streaks sync across your devices using your personal iCloud account. This data is stored in your private iCloud container—we can't see it.

## What We Don't Do

- No analytics or tracking
- No advertising
- No third-party data sharing
- No account required

## Data Storage

All your data lives on your device and in your personal iCloud. Delete the app, and it's gone.
