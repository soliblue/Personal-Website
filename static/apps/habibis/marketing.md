Stay Close to Your People

## About

Life gets busy. Friends drift apart. Not because you don't care—just because time slips away.

Habibis is your gentle nudge to stay connected. Add the people who matter, set how often you want to reach out, and let Habibis remind you when someone's due for a catch-up.

## Features

**Simple by design:**
- Add friends from your contacts
- Choose your rhythm—daily, weekly, monthly
- Get reminders when it's time to reach out
- Log calls, texts, and hangouts with a tap

**Build your streaks:**
Keep the momentum going. The more consistently you stay in touch, the higher your streak climbs—from a tiny spark to legendary status.

**Track your mood:**
Quick check-ins help you notice patterns in how your social life affects how you feel.

**Widgets for your home screen:**
See who's due at a glance without opening the app.

**Your data stays yours:**
Everything syncs privately through iCloud. No accounts, no tracking, no ads.

Habibis. Because friendships don't maintain themselves.
